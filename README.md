# Website Ideias
<img src="./banner.png" alt="Yeah, just code man!" />
Come here every time you feel run out of ideas!

Hello everybody! So, I created this readme to help myself while I was with a creative block, so, if it can help you too, I'll be very glad. Enjoy it!

# Easy

1. Build your on basic portfolio. It needs to contain a header, a section about you, 3 imgs of stuff you did and a footer with your info contact.
2. Do a landing page of a dentist.
3. Help a friend doing a page for his/her job.
4. Do a error page. Whatever error you want and if you don't know which: 404!
5. Do a website about the last thing you study.

# Intermediary

1. Use openCart to create a e-commerce template that you designed.
2. Use Wordpress to create an blog template that you designed.
3. Create a to-do app but not with that fucking boring layout. Be creative!

# Advanced

1. Create a blog with back, front and design by yourself using your favorite language.
2. Make a full fucking system. Yes, you read right: ID design, website, system and a app.
3. Task management UI (with traits just like drag the card, example: <a href="https://codepen.io/aaronmcg/pen/GRjaRva">codepen.io/aaronmcg</a>)
