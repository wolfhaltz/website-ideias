# Website Ideias
Come here every time you feel run out of ideas!

Hello everybody! So, I created this readme to help myself while I was with a creative block, so, if it can help you too, I'll be very glad. Enjoy it!

# Simple

1. Do a landing page of a dentist.
2. Help a friend doing a page for his/her job.

# Intermediary

1. Use openCart to create a e-commerce template that you designed.
2. Use Wordpress to create an blog template that you designed.
3. Create a to-do app but not with that fucking boring layout. Be creative!

# Advanced

1. Create a blog with back, front and design by yourself using your favorite language.
